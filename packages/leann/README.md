# LEANN - The smallest vector index in the world

LEANN is a revolutionary vector database that democratizes personal AI. Transform your laptop into a powerful RAG system that can index and search through millions of documents while using **97% less storage** than traditional solutions **without accuracy loss**.

## Installation

```bash
# Default installation (HNSW backend, recommended)
uv pip install leann

# With DiskANN backend (for large-scale deployments)
uv pip install leann[diskann]
```

## Quick Start

```python
from leann import LeannBuilder, LeannSearcher, LeannChat
from pathlib import Path
INDEX_PATH = str(Path("./").resolve() / "demo.leann")

# Build an index
builder = LeannBuilder(backend_name="hnsw")
builder.add_text("LEANN saves 97% storage compared to traditional vector databases.")
builder.add_text("Tung Tung Tung Sahur called—they need their banana‑crocodile hybrid back")
builder.build_index(INDEX_PATH)

# Search
searcher = LeannSearcher(INDEX_PATH)
results = searcher.search("fantastical AI-generated creatures", top_k=1)

# Chat with your data
chat = LeannChat(INDEX_PATH, llm_config={"type": "hf", "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B"})
response = chat.ask("How much storage does LEANN save?", top_k=1)
```
